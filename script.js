/*
 * Dashboard contract
 * ------------------
 * irrigation/live     ESP1 -> dashboard (latest verified snapshot)
 * irrigation/config   which crop/stage each zone grows, plus each column's own "Firmware save
 *                     settings" library (savedSettings/*). ESP1 does not read this node at all --
 *                     values reach the rig only when the operator fills them into the column
 *                     settings (via a saved setting, "Fill targets from crop profile", or by hand)
 *                     and sends them via SET_COLUMN.
 * irrigation/manual   dashboard -> ESP1 { seq, want }: the Manual/Test hold. ESP1 answers in
 *                     irrigation/live under diagnostics.webManual. Needs its own RTDB rule --
 *                     see Website/firebase-rules.json.
 * irrigation/testHold dashboard -> ESP1 { seq, bit, want }: press-and-hold tests. ESP1 polls it every
 *                     1-3 s, drops the relay 4 s after the last refresh, and caps a hold at 15 s.
 * irrigation/commands dashboard -> ESP1 (ESP1 validates every supported command). ESP1 replies through
 *                     status + detail: queued -> received -> accepted/completed/failed/rejected. The
 *                     detail field holds 47 characters, so longer replies arrive cut off (see
 *                     explainCommandDetail()). "withdrawn" is written only by this page, and only for
 *                     a row still "queued", because ESP1 runs a queued row however old it is.
 *
 * The contract below follows the master's web v.3 firmware (firebaseUploadLive, firebasePollCommands,
 * firebaseCommandTick in ESP1/src/main.cpp). The firmware publishes no version number, so isV3Firmware()
 * tells the generations apart for the few places they differ.
 *
 * Commands ESP1 actually implements, and the exact payload each one expects. Kept complete on
 * purpose -- this drifted out of sync with the real command set once before (only 3 of 14 were
 * listed here for a long stretch).
 *   RUN_PUMP_TEST      { pump: "transfer" | "booster" | "mixer" }   preventive exercise, for the length
 *                        set by SET_EXERCISE (1-10 s). ESP2 raises the inverter first.
 *   FORCE_RUN          { columns: "A"|"B"|"C"|"AB", liters: <=20, doseMl: {A,B,C} (each <=500),
 *                        delaySeconds: 0-300 }   no pH field exists -- see note below. Any dose needs at
 *                        least 6.25 L, and mixing time is fixed by the firmware.
 *   EMERGENCY_STOP     {}   no gating, no confirmation dialog, always actionable
 *   RECOVER            { action: "hold"|"release"|"irrigate"|"normal" }   only while a fault is held
 *   ESTOP_RECOVER      {}   only while stopped (EMERGENCY_STOP) and no fault is held
 *   ENABLE_ACTUATIONS  {}   the one escape hatch checked first, gated on nothing
 *   DISABLE_ACTUATIONS {}   monitoring keeps running
 *   CANCEL_FORCE       {}   only while a forced run is armed/counting down
 *   ACK_FAULT          {}   dashboard-only snooze; no effect on the rig
 *   SET_COLUMN         { col: "A"|"B"|"C", mode?, enabled?, schedMode?, winStart?, winEnd?,
 *                        targetN?, targetP?, targetK?, targetPH?, preset? }   every field but col
 *                        is optional; an absent field is left unchanged, never treated as zero.
 *                        ESP1 still accepts preset (one of its own CROP_PRESETS names, resolved
 *                        server-side) via the LCD/SMS, but this page no longer offers it -- see
 *                        "Firmware save settings" below, which replaced it with the operator's own
 *                        saved N/P/K/pH+mode+schedule combinations instead of ESP1's fixed 4-name
 *                        table.
 *   SET_EXERCISE       { exerciseEnabled?, exerciseSeconds? }
 *   REBOOT             { target: "nano"|"esp2"|"esp1" }
 *   TEST_PULSE         { target, seconds: 1-15 }   Manual/Test only, dead-man timed on ESP2. Whole
 *                        seconds only: ESP1 reads a decimal as 0, then runs its default 5 s.
 *   DIAG_SWEEP         { seconds? }
 *   SET_CLOCK          { clkY, clkMo, clkD, clkH, clkMi }   all required together; sets ESP1's RTC
 *   SET_THRESH         { thStart, thGap }   both required; same clamps as the LCD. Older firmware
 *                        also requires thStop, and web v.3 ignores it.
 *   RESTORE_DEFAULTS   {}   idle-only; runs the same reset function the LCD's Restore Defaults does
 *   CLEAR_BATT_SWITCH  {}   clears a latched battery-switch fault; privileged tier only. Dormant while
 *                        the firmware builds with SECONDARY_BATT_ENABLED 0.
 *   LCD_LOCK           { action: "lock"|"unlock" }   the rig lock: ESP1's own Lock Screen flag, published as
 *                        diagnostics.system.lcdLocked. Privileged tier only, and the row carries byName (the
 *                        sender's own name, checked by the rules). Added to web v.3 on 5 Nov 2026; older firmware
 *                        rejects it as "not a remotely safe control". ESP1 refuses to lock while someone is in its
 *                        LCD menu. While the flag is on, the rules refuse every new row except EMERGENCY_STOP,
 *                        DISABLE_ACTUATIONS, CANCEL_FORCE, ACK_FAULT and LCD_LOCK, and refuse starting a manual
 *                        hold or a hold-to-run press.
 * ESP1 also accepts two legacy names this page does not send: START_PUMP and TOGGLE_MIXER, both of which
 * just run the preventive exercise.
 * Anything else is rejected by ESP1 as "not a remotely safe control", so this page does not offer
 * it. In particular there is no standalone valve command (valves are sequenced inside a work order)
 * and no pH Up/Down dosing target anywhere -- pH is validation-only in the current design; the pH
 * pumps are reachable only via TEST_PULSE's manual, operator-confirmed pulse.
