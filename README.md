# Smart Irrigation — web dashboard

**Live dashboard:** https://jmhatake123.github.io/Website/

Remote monitoring and control for a real hydroponic fertigation rig — built for CIT-U EE Smart
Irrigation / Pinamungahan Automated Farm. Static site (`index.html`, `script.js`, `style.css`) on
GitHub Pages, backed by Firebase Realtime Database and Authentication. ESP1, the rig's master
controller, is the only writer of live telemetry; this page reads it and queues commands that the
firmware validates before acting on — the dashboard has no authority of its own over the hardware.

## About the system

Three controllers, split by role rather than duplicated logic:

- **Arduino Nano** — sensor hub only. Reads soil, NPK, and environment sensors, frames packets,
  sends them on. No decisions, no actuators.
- **ESP32 #1 (master)** — the single source of authority. Scheduling, fault classification, GSM
  alerts, logging, the on-device LCD UI, and everything this dashboard talks to.
- **ESP32 #2 (actuator executor)** — drives the pumps and valves, counts flow, and enforces its own
  local safety stops (dead-man release, overcurrent, mixing-tank hold) even if ESP1 goes silent.

Firmware source: https://github.com/JKyle-N/Smart-Irrigation

## What the dashboard does

- **Rig lock** — one switch, at the top of every tab and on System, that locks this website's controls
  and the buttons on the rig's LCD together. It is ESP1's own Lock Screen flag, so locking or unlocking at
  the rig does the same to the website. Automatic watering carries on; Emergency stop, switching pumps and
  valves off and cancelling a forced run still work. Operators and privileged accounts can lock and unlock.
- **Live Dashboard** — a drawing of the rig with its tanks, pumps and columns as ESP1 reports them,
  readings grouped by what they're about (water, air and light, main battery, solar and the second
  battery), the current run with its pumps, **Up next** beside it (each column's watering times today and
  tomorrow with dates, a forced run counting down, each pump's next exercise), and the recent commands with
  ESP1's replies, read straight from ESP1's telemetry snapshot.
- **Zone Profiles** — one card per column: its soil readings (compared with a crop profile you pick),
  what ESP1 does with it in plain words (what it does, when it runs, its nutrient targets), what it got
  today, an ON/OFF switch, a website-only name, and **Edit settings** (up to 4 watering times a day), which
  sends ESP1 only what you changed and shows the change first. Below them, **Crop profiles**: the built-in
  crops and your own, each with its growth stages.
- **Controls** — emergency stop, a Pumps and valves ON/OFF switch (ESP1's actuation lockout), a forced
  run ("Water a column now") with its countdown and Cancel, and restarting one of the three boards. The
  stops are only sent while ESP1 is reporting: a stop is never left waiting in the queue to fire later,
  so while ESP1 is silent the page says to use the physical cutoff, MODE + BACK on the unit, or SMS STOP,ALL.
- **Manual/Test** *(privileged accounts)* — direct hardware control: a timed test, a hold-to-run test,
  the pump exercise (setting and run-now), and a flow meter check, all under ESP1/ESP2's own dead-man
  timers and safety limits.
- **Diagnostics** — a summary, in words, of anything ESP1 reports as wrong; then ESP1's diagnostic values
  item by item, sensor readings before conversion, an on-demand ESP2 sensor sweep, and recent events.
- **System** *(privileged accounts)* — remote versions of the LCD's Settings menu: the rig lock, clock,
  watering thresholds, battery-switch fault, restore factory settings.
- **User Management** *(operators only)* — the requests waiting for an answer, then accounts grouped by
  status, waiting-for-approval first; approve, reject, restrict, or block them; give or take back control
  and zone editing; give 1-hour access or make a Sub-operator; see each account's online/offline state and
  recent activity in plain words.
- **Help** — how the rig decides when to water and add nutrients, step-by-step guides for each task,
  and a definition of every word the site uses, searchable. The small "i" icons across the site give
  the short version and link to the matching Help entry.

Access is tiered — pending / approved / restricted / rejected / blocked, plus the operator accounts, two
separate grants an approved account can ask for (control, and zone editing), and an optional temporary or
Sub-operator elevation on top of "approved" — and enforced server-side by `firebase-rules.json`, not just
by what the page shows or hides. Only approved accounts and operators can see readings: pending,
restricted, rejected and blocked accounts see only a page to ask for access, and an account restricted
while its page is open loses them immediately.

## Tech stack

Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, no framework or build step · Firebase Realtime Database + Authentication ·
GitHub Pages, auto-deployed on push to `main` (see `.github/workflows/static.yml`) · a small Vercel
function (`delete-user-api`) for the one operation Firebase Auth can't do client-side — permanently
deleting a user account.

## Realtime Database layout

| Node | Written by | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `irrigation/live` | ESP1 only | Telemetry snapshot, faults, event log, `diagnostics.webManual` |
| `irrigation/commands/$id` | page (queued) → ESP1 (status) | One-shot commands; ESP1 validates every payload. The page may also change a row from `queued` to `withdrawn` (not `EMERGENCY_STOP`, `DISABLE_ACTUATIONS` or `CANCEL_FORCE`), because ESP1 runs a queued row however old it is. While `irrigation/live/diagnostics/system/lcdLocked` is true (the rig lock), a new row must be `EMERGENCY_STOP`, `DISABLE_ACTUATIONS`, `CANCEL_FORCE`, `ACK_FAULT` or `LCD_LOCK`. `LCD_LOCK` needs the privileged tier, and an optional `byName` must be the sender's own name (or `Operator` for an operator account). Since 2026-11-05 a new row needs `controlAccess` (every type but `SET_COLUMN`, the stops included) or `zoneEditAccess` (`SET_COLUMN`), or the privileged tier; withdrawing follows the same split. `SET_COLUMN` may carry `windows` (2026-11-05): every own watering time of the column as `[[start, end], ...]`, 1 to 4 pairs of minutes 0–1439 (the rule checks the shape and range; ESP1 checks the order). The page sends it only to firmware whose snapshot reports each zone's `runs`, and `winStart`/`winEnd` to older firmware. Since 2026-11-06 a new `EMERGENCY_STOP`, `DISABLE_ACTUATIONS` or `CANCEL_FORCE` row is refused when `irrigation/live/meta/updatedAt` is more than 3 minutes old (ESP1 isn't reporting), so a stop never waits in the queue to fire hours later |
| `irrigation/config/zones` | page only | Each column's website name (`name`, 1 to 60 characters, checked by the rule; the page allows 40), the crop and stage it is growing, and its saved setups (`savedSettings`, whose `windows` hold every watering time as `{from, to}`). Written by accounts with zone editing (or Sub-operator, 1-hour access, operators) since 2026-11-05; every approved account reads it. Dashboard-side notes — the numeric targets reach the rig through `SET_COLUMN`, not from here, and ESP1 keeps its own column names (LCD, SMS) |
| `irrigation/config/crops/$crop` | page only, privileged tier | The crop library's changes (2026-11-05): `{name, variety?, notes?, stages: {$stage: {name, order, n, p, k, ph, ec, moisture, days?, notes?}}, updatedAt, updatedBy}` replaces the built-in crop of the same key or adds a new one; `{removed: true}` hides a built-in until it is restored (deleting the key restores it). Written by operators and the privileged tier (1-hour access, Sub-operator), read by every approved account. The rule checks every value (N/P/K 0–2000 ppm, pH 3–9, EC 0–20 mS/cm, moisture 0–100 %, days 0–365, `order` 0–19; the page keeps a crop to 10 stages) and refuses any other field. ESP1 never reads it |
| `irrigation/manual` | page only | `{seq, want}` — the Manual/Test mutual-exclusion hold. ESP1 reads it and answers in `live` under `diagnostics.webManual`. Acquiring (`want:true`) requires the privileged tier (operator/temp-access/sub-operator, see `users/$uid` below) and an unlocked rig; releasing (`want:false`) is open to anyone signed in |
| `irrigation/testHold` | page only | `{seq, bit, want}` — Manual/Test's press-and-hold buttons. ESP1's `firebasePollTestHold()` reads it and drives ESP2's existing `TEST,HOLD`/`TEST,RELEASE` dead-man; `bit` is restricted (by the rule) to the same 10-target whitelist as `TEST_PULSE`'s `target` field (transfer/colA/colB/colC/mixer/nutA/nutB/nutC/phUp/phDn). Starting a hold (`want:true`) needs the privileged tier on an account that is still approved, and an unlocked rig, the same as `irrigation/manual`; releasing is open to anyone signed in. The page registers an `onDisconnect` release while a button is held, because ESP1 acts on a leftover `want:true` when it boots. ESP1 never answers a hold it won't run, so the page switches off any hold button ESP1 would ignore and says why |
| `presence/$uid` | every signed-in session, its own | Since 2026-11-05 one entry per open page, `sessions/$id = {since, lastActive, visible}`, removed by the server (`onDisconnect`) when the page goes; `lastActive` moves only on real use (a tap, a key, scrolling) while the page is on screen, at most once a minute; `lastActive` and `lastSeen` at the top keep the latest for when no page is open. The old `{online, lastChanged}` is still accepted from a page that hasn't reloaded, and is cleared by the new one. Read-restricted to the operator accounts (plus self) — powers User Management's "Active now / Page open but idle / Offline, last active" |
| `activity/$uid` | every signed-in session, its own | `{what, at}` entries: since 2026-11-05 every change made on the website (sign-in and sign-out, rig commands, column and crop edits, requests, account decisions, Manual/Test), not only commands. Read-restricted to **only** the operator accounts, not even the account's own owner — powers User Management's recent actions |
| `users/$uid` | see `status`/`tempAccessUntil`/`subOperator`/`controlAccess`/`zoneEditAccess` | `tempAccessUntil` (ms timestamp) is a 1-hour, operator-granted Manual/Test+System elevation; `subOperator` (boolean) is the same elevation but persistent until an operator withholds it again. `controlAccess` and `zoneEditAccess` (2026-11-05, booleans): an approved account on its own only looks (Live dashboard, Zone profiles, Help); `controlAccess` opens Controls, Diagnostics, the Emergency stop and every rig command except a column's settings, `zoneEditAccess` opens the column cards and `SET_COLUMN`. All four settable only by the operator accounts, never at sign-up, and cleared by User Management the moment status leaves `'approved'`; the rules also ignore them on an account that isn't approved |
| `accessRequests/$uid/$kind` | the account, its own; operators | 2026-11-05. `{state: 'waiting' \| 'declined', at, decidedAt?}`. `$kind` is `approval` (pending or rejected accounts), `unrestrict` (restricted), `zones` or `control` (approved without that access, not Sub-operators); blocked accounts can't ask. An account can ask once at a time (again after a decline), with the server's time, and take a waiting request back; operators read all of them and answer (accept = the grant or status plus removing the request in one write; decline = `state: 'declined'`) |

## Security rules

`firebase-rules.json` is the authoritative copy of the database rules. Rules are enforced
server-side, so keeping them in the repo costs nothing in security and makes changes reviewable.

**After editing it, publish it**: dry-run with `firebase deploy --only database --dry-run`, then run
`firebase deploy --only database`, or paste the whole file into Firebase Console → Realtime Database →
Rules. The deployed copy is the live source; this file is only version control, and the two drift apart
silently if you change one without the other.

`irrigation/manual` needs its rule present or the Manual/Test tab does not work at all — RTDB denies
by default where no rule matches, so without it both the page's write and ESP1's read are rejected
and the hold is never granted. Proceed itself (2026-09-10 revision) no longer waits for that grant —
it reveals the panel for any privileged-tier account regardless of ESP1's connection state, so the
individual test buttons (gated on a fresh snapshot) are what actually stays unusable, not the screen.

Credentials and the device UID live in `Firebase infos.txt` at the repo root, which is gitignored.
